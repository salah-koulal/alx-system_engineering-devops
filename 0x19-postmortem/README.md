Postmortem: Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: January 15, 2024, 10:30 AM to January 15, 2024, 12:45 PM (UTC-5)
Impact: The web application service experienced a complete outage during the incident. Users were unable to access the application, resulting in a 100% service disruption for all users.
Timeline:

10:30 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden drop in server response time.
Actions Taken: The operations team initiated an investigation, focusing on the database and application server components.
Misleading Investigation: Initially, the team suspected a database failure due to high CPU usage, leading to an extensive analysis of the database server.
10:45 AM: No significant issues were found with the database server, so attention shifted to the application server.
11:15 AM: It was discovered that the application server's disk usage had reached its maximum capacity, leading to its failure.
11:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the development team for further analysis and resolution.
12:00 PM: The development team identified a bug in the application code that caused excessive log generation, resulting in the disk filling up rapidly.
12:30 PM: The bug was fixed by optimizing the logging mechanism and implementing log rotation.
12:45 PM: The application server was successfully restarted, and normal service was restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was excessive log generation by the application code, leading to the application server's disk reaching its maximum capacity and failing.
Resolution: The development team fixed the issue by optimizing the logging mechanism to reduce log generation and implemented log rotation to manage log file size. These changes prevented the disk from filling up and resolved the outage.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvement/Fixes:
Implement stricter log level configurations to reduce unnecessary logging.
Set up automated monitoring for disk usage to detect and address potential capacity issues.
Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address any inefficient or excessive logging practices.
Tasks:
Update application logging configuration to limit log verbosity.
Implement log rotation mechanism to manage log file size and prevent disk overflow.
Configure automated monitoring for disk usage thresholds and alerts.
Conduct a comprehensive review of the application codebase to identify and optimize any resource-intensive processes.
Schedule regular code reviews to ensure adherence to logging best practices.
This postmortem provides an overview of an outage incident that occurred on January 15, 2024. It highlights the impact, timeline, root cause, resolution, and steps for improvement to prevent similar issues in the future. By implementing the suggested corrective measures, the team aims to enhance the stability and reliability of the web application service.
